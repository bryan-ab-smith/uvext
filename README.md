# uvext
WebExtensions browser extension to get the UV index in Australian cities.

## Current support
Initial versions are designed for Firefox. However, minor changes are all that should be required to have this work in Chrome.

### Chrome/Chromium Support
Speaking of Chrom(e/ium) support, this is a secondary work in progress. The focus is on Firefox but code for the Chrome version is provided and, let's say, half-workable in its current state.
